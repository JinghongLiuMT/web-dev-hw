The reasons why I have decided to take this class, not only because I am interesting in the coding and also as a Finance and Marketing major student, I really agree that the web design can help me to know how to design my own website and that may be helpful for my financial or marketing carrer.

But what exactly is the internet? From the "Q&A with the Internet" section, I learnt:

- Internet was a result of another experiment called the "ARPANET" which is the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.

- I am shocked by the development of the Internet, because the first internet message sending only can be two simple characters, but now we can upload or download so many data in one time.
