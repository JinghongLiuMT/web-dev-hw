        <p>This book contains thirty stories about the children and teachers at Wayside School. But
before we get to them, there is something you ought to know so that you donâ€™t get confused.</p>
<p>Wayside School was accidentally built sideways.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be only one story high, with thirty classrooms all in a row. Instead it is thirty stories high, with one classroom on each story. The builder said he was very sorry.</p>
<p>The  children  at  Wayside  like  having  a  sideways  school.  They  have  an  extra-large playground.</p>
<p>The children and teachers described in this book all go to class on the top floor. So there are thirty stories from the thirtieth story of Wayside School.</p>
<p>It has been said that these stories are strange and silly. That is probably true. However, when I told stories about you to the children at Wayside, they thought you were strange and silly.</p>
<p>That is probably also true.</p>
