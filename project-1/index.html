    <p>
      The tree has entered my hands,
      <br />
      The sap has ascended my arms,
      <br />
      The tree has grown in my breast-Downward,
      <br />
      The branches grow out of me, like arms.
      <br />
      Tree you are,
      <br />
      Moss you are,
      <br />
      You are violets with wind above them.
      <br />
      A child - so high - you are,
      <br />
      And all this is folly to the world.
      <br />
