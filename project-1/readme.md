# Project 1, My first Webpage.


. The browsers I use to surf and how it works:

I prefer to use Chrome as my Browsers. As I learnt from this topic, we send the request via the network to the servers. And then the servers send back some collectiones of web content as the responses, after received those responses, our browsers translate the content and displays the pages.

. The Wayback Machine:

I used the Wayback Machine to searched the Apple.com, I found there have been 64395 snap shots taken of this site since the internet archive began. And I take back to the year of 1999, I found a total different website with current Apple website. It looks like old and also the products shows in the website is Apple's first computer.

.After finished the first project, I found:

This is really a exciting homework, because I made my first webpage in this world. Before doing this project, the webpage design looks like impossible for me. But now, it really not like a tough work. I do not meet to much tough problem after go through the course website.
